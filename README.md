# Deploy to GitHub Pages

The **Deploy to GitHub Pages** lets you quickly deploy your static web page (Jekyll or HTML) to GitHub Pages without leaving your IDE.

## Why Deploy to GitHub Pages?

The purpose of this extension is to improve convenience for developers, especially newer developers. 

GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. 

## Limitations

- This extension will only trigger a build for websites built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks such as React, Vue, or Angular.
- GitHub Pages will use Jekyll to build your site by default.
- GitHub Pages does not support websites built with server-side languages such as PHP, Ruby, or Python.
